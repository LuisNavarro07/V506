# Quick Recap of Lab 1

- R is an object oriented programming language. Every object receives a name and has characteristics specific to its type and structure. 

- Object types in R: integers, numeric (continuous variables), characters (strings, text), logical (TRUE or FALSE). 

- Data structures: vectors, matrices, lists, factors, data frames (tibbles). 

- Functions: set of statements organized to perform a specific task. Input-output relationship. 

- Example: Create a data frame with information of IU students. 

- Step 1: Define the data for each variable 

- *Tip:* Note how the `#` symbol allows to comment the code. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# Define a vector of names 
names <- c("Abby", "Bobby", "Carl", "Dany", "Emma", "Fernando", "Gary", "Harry", "Ian", "Jerry")
# Define a vector of ages 
ages <- c(15,46,35,44,21,19,55,70,12,65)
# Define a vector of majors 
majors <- factor(c("Accounting", "Business", "Public Policy", "Business", "Public Policy", "Economics", "Political Science", "Economics", "Public Policy", "Business"))
# Define a vector of GPAs 
gpa <- c(3.2, 4.0, 3.8, 2.9, 2.8, 2.5, 3.4, 3.6, 4.0, 2.3)
```

- Step 2: Create a data frame. Use the function `data.frame`

- *Tip:* you can write your code with vertical spaces so it reads easier.  

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
iu_students <- data.frame(
  student_names = names, 
  student_ages = ages, 
  degree = majors, 
  GPA = gpa
)
```

- Step 3. Visualize and inspect the data 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
head(iu_students)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
summary(iu_students)
```

- Step 4. Compute basic descriptive statistics using base R 

- Check the structure of the data set 
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# Number of Observations 
nrow(iu_students)
length(iu_students$student_names)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# Number of Variables 
ncol(iu_students)

# Str Function tells you the number of rows and columns  
str(iu_students)
```

- Some key statistics. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# Average Age 
mean(iu_students$student_ages)

# Standard Deviation of Age 
sd(iu_students$student_ages)

# Median GPA 
median(iu_students$GPA)

# Frequency Table (Note: the function "table" works better with factor variables)
table(iu_students$degree)
```

# Data and Packages

- Today, we will use dplyr to clean an existing data frame and learn some base R commands for data analysis.
- We will also learn some base R commands for data visualization.
- We will be working with dplyr, which is part of the tidyverse
- Install "tidyverse" or "dplyr" for today.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(tidyverse)
```

# Import Data into R 


*Base R:* 

Set the path to the folder where your data is 

```{r}
filepath <- "/Users/luisenriquenavarro/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-IndianaUniversity/V506/Fall24/Lab2/"
filename <- "buses.csv"
# Use paste function to create the full name (address) of the file 
buses_path <- paste(filepath,filename, sep="")
print(buses_path)
```

Use `read.csv` function to import the file. 

```{r}
buses <- read.csv(file = buses_path)
```

Tip: if you cannot find your file, you can check choose it using `file.choose`. 

Note: this is code just to check how to write the location of your file or for one-time assignments. Avoid it for code that you run regularly. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
new_data <- read.csv(file = file.choose())
```


*Using here and rio:* 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Install library here if you haven't already 
install.packages("here")
install.packages("rio")
# load them
library(here)
library(rio)
# Alternative way to load them: use pacman 
p_load(here, rio)
```

Set the path to the folder where your data is 

```{r}
v506_path <- here('/Users/luisenriquenavarro/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-IndianaUniversity/V506/Fall24')

# You can create the paths for each folder with this object easily
lab1_path <- here(v506_path,'Lab1')
lab2_path <- here(v506_path,'Lab2')
```

Use import function from rio. 

```{r}
buses_df <- import(file = here(lab2_path, 'buses.csv'))
```

## Explore the data frame

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
head(buses) # first 6 rows
View(buses) # opens a separate window with a spreadsheet view 
summary(buses) # summary statistics for each column
glimpse(buses) # transposed view of the data frame 
names(buses) # returns the column names from the data frame 
nrow(buses) # counts and returns the number of rows in the data frame
```

# Functions for data wrangling: select

- The function select() allows you to select variables by their name in a data frame and save this as a new data frame, for example:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# The ":" lets you select the range of columns from ID to Capacity
df1 = select(buses, ID:Capacity) 
# You can use c(Column 1, Column 2, etc.) to denote which columns to select 
df2 = select(buses, c(ID, Capacity))
# Using the ! means that it will take everything except ID:Capacity (remember ! means "not")
df3 = select(buses, !ID:Capacity)
# Select only the numeric variables
df4 = select(buses, where(is.numeric)) 
```

- Let's find out how it looks. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# The ":" lets you select the range of columns from ID to Capacity
head(df1)
# Using the ! means that it will take everything except ID:Capacity (remember ! means "not")
head(df4)
```


# Functions for data wrangling: "select" in base R 

- In base R, you can select among columns using square brackets:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
df[rows, columns]
# This takes all rows and columns 1-3 
df[, c(1:3)]
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# This allows you to subset the dataframe using square brackets, first 5 columns
df5 = buses[, c(1:5)]
# Selecting two columns (col 1 and 4)
df6 = buses[, c(1,4)] 
# Selecting all but the first 5 columns
df7 = buses[, -c(1:5)]
```

# Functions for data wrangling: filter and subset 

- filter() is also used to subset a data frame, but instead of specifying the column names, it retains rows that satisfy the conditions you specify. 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Filter the buses data frame to include only those where Capacity is 14 
filter(buses, Capacity==14)
# Filter the buses data frame to include only those that are 5 years old or less.
filter(buses, Age <=5)
```

- With base R:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Here, we are using the subset function instead of filter to do the same action
subset(buses, Capacity==14)
subset(buses, Age <=5)
```

# Functions for data wrangling: mutate 

- mutate() adds new variables and preserves existing ones.

- Create a new dataframe and add a column Age2 and lnCapacity: 
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
temp2 = mutate(buses, Age2 = Age^2, lnCapacity = log(Capacity))
```

- Verify the new data frame has two additional variables. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
head(temp2[,c(1,2,5,7,10,11)])
```

- Only keep the variables used to create the new variables:
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
mutate(buses, .keep= "used", Age2 = Age^2, lnCapacity = log(Capacity))
```

- *With Base R:* we can add new variables to the data frame with the dollar sign `$` syntax. 

- Example: create a variable that computes the square root of the age. 

- Note: for this case we need to apply the function to the vector of Ages, and then assign the result to the data frame `buses` as a new variable. 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
buses$SqAge = sqrt(buses$Age)
head(buses)
```


# Functions for data wrangling: slice 

- slice() allows you to keep rows by their location in the data.frame. (This can be similar to head or tail but more functionality)

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
slice(buses, 1:5) # show the first five rows of the data frame 
slice(buses, n()) # defaults to showing 1 row only 
slice(buses, 75:80) # last five rows of data frame 
slice_head(buses, n=5)
slice_tail(buses, n=5)
slice_max(buses, order_by = Odometer.Miles, n = 1)
slice_min(buses, order_by = Odometer.Miles, n = 3)
```

# Functions for data wrangling: bind_rows and rbind 

- bind_rows() and rbind() allow you to append rows to an existing data frame 
- For both, the new rows must have the same number of columns. For bind_rows, the variable names must be the same 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Top 10 Manufacturers by Capacity
df1 = slice_max(buses, order_by = Capacity, n = 10)
# Bottom 10 Manufacturers by Miles
df2 = slice_min(buses, order_by = Miles, n = 10)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# With dplyr
new_df = bind_rows(df1, df2)
# With base R 
new_df2 = rbind(df1, df2)    
```

# Functions for data wrangling: cbind

- cbind() allows you to merge or combine data frames by columns. For example, if you create a new vector for age squared:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
age2 = (buses$Age)^2
```

And want to add it to the buses data frame, you can use cbind():

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
buses = cbind(buses,age2)
head(buses, n= 5)
```

# Functions for data visualization: plot 

- plot() allows you to create scatterplots of your data. You can specify the x and y coordinates
- plot(x,y,...) is the simple command 
- Adding a main title is done through "main=", the y-axis title is "ylab=" and the x-axis title is "xlab="
- Colors are denoted through "col=" (here is a cheat sheet on R colors:http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf)

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
plot(buses$Age, buses$Odometer.Miles, main = "Bus Age and Odometer Mileage", 
     xlab = "Age", ylab="Miles", type="p", col = "blue")
```

# Functions for data visualization: plot 
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
plot(buses$Age, buses$Miles, main = "Bus Age and Mileage", 
     xlab = "Age", ylab="Miles", type="p", col = "darkgrey")
```

# Functions for data visualization: hist 

- hist() allows you to create histograms.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
hist(buses$Age, main = "Bus Age Distribution", 
     xlab = "Age", ylab = "Count", col = "lightcoral")
```

# Functions for data visualization: boxplot  

- summary() of the variable "Odometer.Miles":
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
summary(buses$Odometer.Miles)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
boxplot(buses$Odometer.Miles, main = "Odometer Miles Boxplot", 
        ylab="Miles", col = "lightseagreen")
```

# Functions for data visualization: boxplot in horizontal form

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
summary(buses$Miles)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
boxplot(buses$Miles, main = "Miles Boxplot", xlab="Miles", 
        border = "steelblue", col = "lightgrey", horizontal = TRUE, 
        frame = FALSE)
```
