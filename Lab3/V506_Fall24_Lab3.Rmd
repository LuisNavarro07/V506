- ggplot

# Clean Environment Question 

- To remove specific objects from the environment you can use the `rm` function. 

- We covered that the following code removes all objects stored in the environment. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

- Let's say you want to only erase a some objects from your environment. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# Define objects 
temp1 <- 1:10
temp2 <- 11:20
temp3 <- 21:30
# Erase object temp1
rm(temp1)
# Erase objects temp2 and temp3
rm(list = c("temp2", "temp3"))
```

# Install Packages for Today

- Let's install all the packages we will be using today.

- *Tip* notice we can write the statement in one line of code. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning =FALSE }
if(!require(pacman)) {install.packages("pacman")}
if(!require(rmarkdown)) {install.packages("rmarkdown")}
if(!require(here)) {install.packages("here")}
if(!require(dplyr)) {install.packages("dplyr")}
if(!require(ggplot2)) {install.packages("ggplot2")}
if(!require(gridExtra)) {install.packages("gridExtra")}
```

- Let's use *p_load* to load all the packages we will be using into the environment. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning =FALSE }
library(pacman)
p_load(rmarkdown,dplyr,ggplot2,gridExtra,here)
```


# Programming Basics 

- Logical expressions (also called Boolean expressions) are the result of applying logical operators to relational or arithmetic expressions. 

- The result of an operation has two possible states: true or false.

- You can think them as questions or conditions. Ex. Is $a > b$?  

- Programming tip: using these expressions we can tell the computer to execute a specific task when certain conditions are met. 

- There are several logical operators. 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
> # greater than 
< # less than 
>= # greater than or equal to 
<= # less than or equal to 
== # exactly equal to 
!= # not equal to 
!  # not 
|  # or 
&  # and 
```

# Logical Expressions and Logical Operators 

- Define 2 objects, $a$ and $b$. Let's explore their relationship. 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Define a and b
x = 5
y = 10 

# Logical Expressions. 
# is x greater than y ? 
x>y 
# is x greater or equal than y ? 
x>=y
# is x less or equal than y ? 
x<=y 
# is x equal to y ? 
x==y 
# is x not equal to y ? 
x!=y 
```

- **Note:** They can be applied to vectors too (and other objects as well!). 

```{r}
# Define a sequence of numbers from 1 to 15 
seq <- c(1:15)
# Create an array with TRUE or FALSE, depending on the result of the logical test 
great15 <- seq>=5  
# Explore it 
print(great15)
summary(great15)
```

# Conditional Statements 

- Conditional statements or expressions tell the computer to execute certain actions, provided certain conditions are met.

- The code is executed if and only if the pre-stated conditions are either true or false, depending on the functions the programmer has in mind.

- Syntax *if* and between parentheses the conditional statement. In between brackets you write the action to be done.  

- Example: if $x>y$ then print *apples are better than bananas*  

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
if(x>y){
  print("Apples are better than Bananas")
}
```


# Conditional Operators: ifelse()

-   ifelse() is a conditional operator.
-   The usage is: 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ifelse(test, yes, no)
```

-   In the first part of the argument, you enter the test (logical or conditional expression) which will should have a logical outcome (TRUE or FALSE)
-   "yes" returns the value for the true elements of the test 
-   "no" returns the value for the false elements of the test. 

- Example. For numbers between 5 and 10, return 1, and 0 otherwise. 
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
seq <- c(1:15)
print(seq)
# Conditional Operator
test <- seq>= 5  & seq <=10
ifelse(test,1,0)
```



# Pipes: Background 

- Pipes are a powerful tool for clearly expressing a sequence of multiple operations.

- Pipe = *%>%* comes from the **magrittr** package (part of tidyverse). 

- To insert a pipe into your code: 

-- For Windows: Ctrl + Shift + M

-- For Mac: Cmd + Shift + M

- Remember R is object oriented. You are regularly applying functions to objects. Pipes provide a simple way to instrument this operation and make the code to read better.   

- *Benefit:* Pipes allow to write and visualize code as an ordered list of steps. Best practice. 

# Pipes: Math Intution 

*Pipes* are operators to indicate we are applying a function to an object. 

- Example: Define $y$ as a function $f$ of $x$. 

- $y = f(x)$

*Pipes* allow us to write this in a different way. $y$ is equal to $x$ after applying $f$ to it. 

- $y = x$ *%>%* $f$

- Example with code: function composition. 

- Let $y = t(x)$ and $z = h(y)$ where $f$ and $h$ are two different functions. 

- To compute $z$ I first apply $f$ to $x$ and then I apply $h$ to the output of that operation.  

- $z = h(t(x))$

- Let $t$ be the *tibble* function and $h$ the *head* function. Hence, $z$ shows the top part of a tibble object.

- Intuition: you are applying functions in ordered layers. 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Define a data frame x
a = c(1:50)
b = c(101:150)
x <- data.frame(v1=a,v2=b,v3=a>3, v4=b<103)
```
 

- *Standard Approach*

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
y <- tibble(x)
z <- head(y)
z
```
 
- *With Pipes* we can write the functions as an ordered list. First a convert to tibble, then apply head function. 

_ Tip: use vertical spaces to write your code as a list. Each additional step is applied to the object resulting from the previous operation. 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
z <- x %>% 
  tibble() %>% 
  head()
z
```


# Examples: Pipes in Dplyr 

Load the Star Wars data set available at the dplyr library. It contains characteristics on Star Wars characters. 

- *Tip:* you can write the name of the library followed by `::` to access objects (e.g. functions, data sets) from such library. 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
starwars <- dplyr::starwars
```

Explore it. 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  glimpse()
```
Define a data frame that only contains all the female characters. 

- Hint: the arrange function allows you to sort the data. Read its documentation. 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Filter only female characters
sw_female <- starwars %>% 
  filter(sex=="female") 
# Show the top 10 rows of the data set and order it by home world. 
sw_female %>%  arrange(by_group = homeworld) %>% 
  head(n = 10L) 
```

- We can write multiple operations in one line of code. 

- Question: what is this code doing? 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
starwars %>% filter(height > 150) %>% 
             select(name, height, mass, homeworld) %>% 
             arrange(by_group = name) %>% 
             arrange(by_group = homeworld) %>% 
             head(n=10L)
```

# Pipes and Mutate 

- Pipes provide a nice syntax to create new variables. 

- Example: create a dummy variable equal to one for female characters. 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
starwars <- starwars %>% 
            mutate(female = ifelse(sex == "female",1,0)) 
```

- Let's look at the relevant variables 


```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, sex, female) %>% 
  arrange(by_group = name) %>%
  head(n=6L)
```
- We can keep creating variables using pipes. 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
starwars <- starwars %>% 
            mutate(height160 = ifelse(height > 160, 1,0)) %>% 
            mutate(mass_height160int = mass*height160)

# Show the new variables 
starwars %>% select(name,homeworld,mass, height, 
                    height160, mass_height160int) %>% 
             head(n=10L)
```

# ggplot

- ggplot is perhaps the most famous R graphing package. Also part of tidyverse. 

-   ggplot is based on the "grammar of graphics" which is the idea that you can build every graph from the same components: data, coordinate system, and geoms (the visual marks that represent the data/the type of graph)

-   ggplot() is the function that initializes the ggplot object. It can be used to specify the data frame or the aesthetics. 

-  Every ggplot2 plot has three key components:

    --A data frame,

    --A set of aesthetic mappings between variables in the data and visual properties, and

    --At least one layer which describes how to render each observation. Layers are usually created with a geom function.

- Each component is a **layer**. Additional components are added using **+**. 

- Each component adds an element to format the graph. 

- With the layers, you can also layer more than one plot -- that means that you can add a layer with multiple 

- You should use the ggplot cheat sheet available on R -- this will be incredibly helpful! 

# Plots of one variable 

- Let's load the *mpg* data set which includes information about the fuel economy of popular car models in 1999 and 2008, collected by the US EPA. You can access the data by loading ggplot2. 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
mpg <- ggplot2::mpg %>% tibble()
mpg %>% glimpse()
```

- Let's begin with graphs of one variable. Ex. Histogram. 

- At least 3 elements: i) data, ii) aesthetic mapping, iii) geom with type of graph. 

- The data contains the tibble with the variables to be graphed. 

- The aesthetic mapping creates the space to show the graph. 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Variable notes: 
# hwy: highway miles per gallon
# manufacturer: manufacturer name 
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = hwy)) 
```

- The geom object specifies the way to visualize the data (i.e. the type of plot you want to create). 

- *Note:* to add elements to the graph you need to use the plus `+` operator. You `add` layers to the graph. 

- Example: Histogram of the distribution of the variable `highway miles per gallon`  


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = hwy)) +
      geom_histogram() 
```

- Tip: Assign names to the graphs. 

- Explore all the available options to customize your graph. 

- Add parameters to geom_histogram. 

- Labs allow to write the labels. Also, you can choose from different themes.

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
hwy_histogram <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy)) + 
                 geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black", fill = "lightblue" ) + 
                 labs(x = "Highway milage/gallon", y = "Count", title = "Highway milage histogram") 
hwy_histogram
```

- We can add layers to already defined graphs to create more complex (and cool) figures! 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
hwy_histogram_improved <- hwy_histogram +
                          theme_bw() + 
                          geom_density(aes(y = ..count..), color = "red", size = 1) 
hwy_histogram_improved
```

- Let's do a boxplot of the city milage/gallon variable. 
 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
cty_box <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty)) + 
                 geom_boxplot(color = "black", fill = "lightblue" ) + 
                 theme_bw() + 
                labs(x = "City milage/gallon", title = "City milage box plot") 
cty_box
```

# Combining plots and exporting plots. 

- **Combining Plots** We can combine plots using the *gridExtra* library (be sure to install it and load it first)

- **Exporting Plots:** use *ggsave* to export a ggplot object. You can choose the export format by changing the file extension (png, jpg, pdf).

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Where to store the graph 
v506_path <- here("/Users/luisenriquenavarro/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-IndianaUniversity/V506/Fall24")
file <- here(v506_path, 'Lab3','combinedplot.jpg')
# Save the graph 
graph_combined <- grid.arrange(hwy_histogram_improved,cty_box, nrow =2, ncol = 1)
ggsave(filename = file, plot = graph_combined)
```


# Plots of two variables 

- We can create graphs using aesthetic mappings of two variables. 

- Example: scatter plots. Aesthetic mappings identify the $x$ and $y$ variables. 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
scatter_hc <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
              geom_point(color = "red", shape = 18) +
              labs(x = "City milage/gallon", y = "Highway milage/gallon", title = "Correlation City and Highway milage per gallon") + 
              theme_bw()
scatter_hc
```


- **Creating Graphs by Categories** you can create the same graph for different categories in your data set. 

- Let's replicate the previous graph for each *class* of vehicles. 

```{r}
mpg$class %>% factor() %>% summary()
```

- *facet_wrap* shows individual graphs for each category. 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
scatter_hc_class1 <- scatter_hc + facet_wrap(~ class, nrow=4)
scatter_hc_class1
```

- Alternatively, you can specify a color-coding when defining the aesthetic mapping. 

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
scatter_hc_class2 <- ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, colour = class)) + 
                    geom_point(shape = 16, size = 3) +
                    labs(x = "City milage/gallon", y = "Highway milage/gallon", title = "Correlation City and Highway milage per gallon") + 
                    theme_bw()
scatter_hc_class2
```
